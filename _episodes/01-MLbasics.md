title: "Basics of Machine Learning"
teaching: 15
exercises: 120
questions:
- "What are the inputs of a machine learning model?"
- "What types of outputs (predictions) can machine learning models make?"
- "How does a machine learning model make predictions from its inputs?"
- "What are key steps in a workflow for building machine learning models?"
objectives:
- "Students are introduced to model types, key outputs, and metrics for assessing performance"
- "Students are introduced to effective practices for maintaining a useful record of research"
- "Students continue to learn about model types, key outputs, and metrics for assessing performance"
- "Students continue discussing effective practices for maintaining a useful record of research"
keypoints:
- "Inputs to machine learning models are called features. Some datasets may come with features, other times they need to be generated using knowledge of the specific data."
- "Machine learning models can make predictions of numbers (regression), or classes (classification). There are different types of models more suited to different tasks."
- "A machine learning model is an algorithm for finding patterns / relationships between the input features and an output."
- "We can break down a workflow for builing machine learning models into key steps: feature generation, Feature Engineering, Model Assessment, Model Optimization, and Model Predictions"

> ## Readings
> Here are a few nice introductory articles discussing machine learning basics. 
> They cover the topic from slightly different perspectives, and go into some concepts which will be covered in more detail in other modules here.

> ## Activity: Introduction to Machine Learning for Materials Science
> 
> The primary activity for this module using the Nanohub platform. 
> To get started you will need to either create an account or log in with an existing google account to be able to run the tools hosted there.  
>  
> **Important!** Saving your work in Nanohub is a bit tricky. Follow these instructions to create a copy of the notebook once you've launched the tool via the link below.
>  
> 1. With your notebook open make a copy if you haven’t already using the File drop down menu in the top left. Then save the copy by clicking “save and checkpoint”.
> 2. Open the Nanohub Jupyter tool by hitting launch tool here: https://nanohub.org/tools/jupyter
> 3. Navigate to the folder “data/results/####/intromllab/bin/”. Note the number will be a unique number associated with your session. Pick the most recent once if there are multiple (or an older one if you are looking for an older saved file).
> 4. Double click the notebook file “intromllab-Copy1.ipynb” to launch your saved notebook.
> 5. You can now save this notebook freely, and to return to this notebook later launch the same tool as step 2 and follow the instructions from there.
>  
> **Note: do not move the notebook or else some aspects of the code will break.**
>  
> Follow the Link to get started: [Nanohub Introduction to ML Lab](https://nanohub.org/tools/intromllab/)
>  
> > ## Extra Help
> > If you are starting with little to no background with python programming, or have never used a Jupyter Notebook before it may help to follow along with the video below.
> >  
> > Additionally you may find it useful to review the introductory modules on python programming.
