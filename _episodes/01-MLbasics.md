title: "Basics of Machine Learning"
teaching: 15
exercises: 120
questions:
- "What are the inputs of a machine learning model?"
- "What types of outputs (predictions) can machine learning models make?"
- "How does a machine learning model make predictions from its inputs?"
- "What are key steps in a workflow for building machine learning models?"
objectives:
- "Students are introduced to model types, key outputs, and metrics for assessing performance"
- "Students are introduced to effective practices for maintaining a useful record of research"
- "Students continue to learn about model types, key outputs, and metrics for assessing performance"
- "Students continue discussing effective practices for maintaining a useful record of research"
keypoints:
- "Inputs to machine learning models are called features. Some datasets may come with features, other times they need to be generated using knowledge of the specific data."
- "Machine learning models can make predictions of numbers (regression), or classes (classification). There are different types of models more suited to different tasks."
- "A machine learning model is an algorithm for finding patterns / relationships between the input features and an output."
- "We can break down a workflow for builing machine learning models into key steps: feature generation, Feature Engineering, Model Assessment, Model Optimization, and Model Predictions"
