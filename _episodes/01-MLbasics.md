title: "Basics of Machine Learning"
teaching: 25
exercises: 120
questions:
- "What are the inputs of a machine learning model?"
- "what are basic types of ml models, how do they differ?"
- "What types of outputs (predictions) can machine learning models make?"
- "How does a machine learning model make predictions from its inputs?"
- "What are key steps in a workflow for building machine learning models?"
- "How can we save a Jupyter Notebook on Nanohub?"

objectives:
- "Students can list several basic machine learning model types, the types of predictions that can be made, and metrics for assessing performance"
- "Students will create an account on Nanohub and learn how to run tools there"
- "Students can define assessment metrics'
- "Students practice saving and interacting with tools on Nanohub"
- "Students are introduced to effective practices for maintaining a useful record of research"
- "Students continue to learn about model types, key outputs, and metrics for assessing performance"
- "Students continue discussing effective practices for maintaining a useful record of research"
keypoints:
- "Inputs to machine learning models are called features. Some datasets may come with features, other times they need to be generated using knowledge of the specific data."
- "Machine learning models can make predictions of numbers (regression) or classes (classification). Different model types are suited to different types of predictions."
- "A machine learning model is an algorithm for finding patterns (relationships) between the input features and an output."
- "The workflow (process) for building machine learning models is broken down into key steps: Feature Generation, Feature Engineering, Model Assessment, Model Optimization, and Model Predictions"

> ## Readings
> Here are a few nice introductory articles discussing machine learning basics. 
> They cover the topic from slightly different perspectives, and go into some concepts which will be covered in more detail in other modules here.

> ## Activity: Introduction to Machine Learning for Materials Science
> 
>  This activity will take sections of lecture and give a hands on example of working through key steps in a machine learning workflow for training and assessing models.
> In order to complete this activity you will need to either create an account or log in with an existing google account to be able to run the tool at the following link: [Machine Learning Activity](https://nanohub.org/tools/intromllab/)  
>  
> **Important!** Saving your work in Nanohub is a bit tricky. Follow these instructions to create a copy of the notebook once you've launched the tool via the link.
>  
> 1. With your notebook open (by clicking the launch tool button) make a copy if you haven’t already using the File drop down menu in the top left. Then save the copy by clicking “save and checkpoint”.
> 2. Open the Nanohub Jupyter tool by hitting launch tool here: https://nanohub.org/tools/jupyter
> 3. Navigate to the folder “data/results/####/intromllab/bin/”. Note the number will be a unique number associated with your session. Pick the most recent once if there are multiple (or an older one if you are looking for an older saved file).
> 4. Double click the notebook file “intromllab-Copy1.ipynb” to launch your saved notebook.
> 5. You can now save this notebook freely, and to return to this notebook later launch the same tool as step 2 and follow the instructions from there.
>  
> **Note: do not move the notebook or save to another location on nanohub's virtual computer or else some aspects of the code will break.**

>  
> > ## Extra Help
> > If you are starting with little to no background with python programming, or have never used a Jupyter Notebook before it may help to follow along with the video.
> >  
> > Additionally you may find it useful to review the introductory modules on python programming via [software carpentry](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o9nzKC2fXTaKIHXot-WLBcZkM1lKAhOj?usp=sharing)
