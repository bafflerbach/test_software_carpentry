MAST-ML is a machine learning workflow software package built in python that leverages several other underlying python libraries to enable users to build and test models with little to no python background.

If you have a little more programming background you can check out the github page for the code below to see a bit about how itâ€™s structured. There is usually ongoing efforts in the skunkworks to improve and add features to MAST-ML so if this is something you might be interested in let us know!
