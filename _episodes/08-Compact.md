## Background  

The Group Compact is meant to help define expectations of the group relationship. It helps us think about goals, responsibilities, best practices, and will hopefully allow everyone to have a fulfilling and enjoyable time during their participation.
  


> ## Activity: Reflect on actions in "Introduction to Citrination" module  
>  Work together to develop content in the following suggested categories below. Sample questions to consider are provided to start the conversation. Consider this as simply a guide because you will want to adapt the Group Compact framework to meet your needs.
>  
> Consider what you develop to be a living document, meaning we want input from everyone as we continue to work together to further define and refine how the education group is run.
